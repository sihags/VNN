# VNN

Synthetic data experiments for paper on coVariance Neural Networks.


Jupyter notebook Synthetic_Data_Experiments.ipynb stores the
implementation of stability analysis for VNNs and PCA-regression models
for synthetic data experiments in Appendix-D of the paper coVariance Neural Networks. The VNNs are based on slight
modifications of the GNN libraries from
https://github.com/alelab-upenn/graph-neural-networks and these
libraries have been included in the Modules and Utils folders as such.

Dependencies:

Python 3.8.5

torch==1.10.2

scikit-learn==0.23.2

pandas==1.1.3
